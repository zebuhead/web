                  <p align="justify">John holds a Bachelor of Science in Applied Environmental and Spatial Analysis.
                  He is currently a first-year graduate student in the Energy and Resources Group at UC Berkeley.
                  John is broadly interested in the transactional relationship between humans and their environment.
                  Furthermore, he is interested in the manner which rapidly emerging technologies such as GIS and Remote
                  Sensing will assist in understanding that relationship. John has research interests in land use,
                  water , energy, sustainable development, environmental ethics, environmental history, economics, and policy.
                  His academic pursuits span the physical and social sciences as he believes future challenges will require
                  modes of inquiry that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.

                    everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our
                    joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and
                    forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant,
                    every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher
                    of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner
                    in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
                    The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the
                    inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other
                    corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

                    Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so
                    that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

                    Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the
                    Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great
                    enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come
                    from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.</font></p>

                    The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near
                    future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment
                    the Earth is where we make our stand.

                    It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no
                    better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me,
                    it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the
                    pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”</font></p>
